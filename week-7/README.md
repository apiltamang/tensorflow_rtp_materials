**Plain Vanilla LSTM**
The figure below is adapted from Christopher Olah's blog post on LSTM, and is one of the most frequently cited post on this matter.

Notes:
------
The notebooks contain a much more in-depth discussion and comments of the construction process. A plain vanilla RNN and LSTM each is built from a scratch in the provided notebooks, as well as an equivalent architecture built using tensorflow-provided BasicRNNCell and BasicLSTMCell blocks. No attempts for optimal solutions are made, and these notebooks are simply attempts to learn basic usages of these blocks.
